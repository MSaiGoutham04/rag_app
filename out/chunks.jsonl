On the\ncertification details page, you’ll find information about what skills are measured and links to\nregistration. Each exam also has its own details page covering exam specifics.\nCertification Once you earn your certification, don’t let it expire. When you have an active\nrenewal certification that’s expiring within six months, you should renew it—at no cost—\nby passing a renewal assessment on Microsoft Learn. Remember to renew your\ncertification annually if you want to retain it.\nYour Microsoft Connecting your certification profile to Learn brings all your learning activities\nLearn profile together. You’ll be able to schedule and renew exams, share and print\ncertificates, badges and transcripts, and review your learning statistics inside\nyour Learn profile.\nPassing score All technical exam scores are reported on a scale of 1 to 1,000. A passing score\nis 700 or greater. As this is a scaled score, it may not equal 70% of the points. A\npassing score is based on the knowledge and skills needed to demonstrate\ncompetence as well as the difficulty of the questions.\nExam sandbox Are you new to Microsoft", "chunk_id": "D:\\RAG\\input\\AI-102_StudyGuide_ENU_FY23Q1_7.1.pdf-p0-c0-0d222975", "token_count": 350}
